To run a demo of the game engine, run main.py. main.py includes a simple game loop and demonstrates graphics
rendering module functionality. You can also enter keyboard input to move the player within the game window.

Note: For some operating systems, you might need to change your privacy or accessibility settings to allow the program
to monitor keyboard input.
